Question 1. Do you have to do anything else to ensure that this I/O privilege setting is saved 
and restored properly when you subsequently switch from one environment to another? Why?
Answer: To ensure that the I/O privilege setting is saved and restored properly, it must be saved. 
The state of the EFLAGS register should be saved when switching enviroments because the IOPL flag 
is stored in the EFLAGS register.
